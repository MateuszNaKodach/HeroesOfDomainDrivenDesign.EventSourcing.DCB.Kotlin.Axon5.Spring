# proophboard Event Modeling

Work with proophboard boards via MCP to read, create, and modify event models.

## Before You Start

### 1. Resolve Workspace ID
Read `.proophboard/workspace.json` from the repository root.
- **If the file exists**: use the `workspace_id` from it.
- **If the file does not exist**:
  1. Call `mcp__proophboard__list_workspaces` to list all available workspaces
  2. Ask the user which workspace to use via `AskUserQuestion` (present workspace names as options)
  3. Write the selected workspace to `.proophboard/workspace.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "workspace_id": "<selected-id>",
       "workspace_name": "<selected-name>"
     }
     ```

### 2. Load Chapter Context
1. Call `mcp__proophboard__list_chapters` to discover available chapters
2. Call `mcp__proophboard__get_chapter` to load full chapter structure (lanes, slices, elements)

Always `get_chapter` before any modifications — all update operations require current `old_*` values.

For Event Modeling conventions and rules, read [references/guidelines.md](references/guidelines.md).
For MCP API parameters, use ToolSearch to discover `mcp__proophboard__*` tools on demand.

## Core Concepts

### Board Structure
```
Chapter (a user journey / business process path)
├── Lanes (horizontal rows)
│   ├── user-lane     → UI, Automation, HotSpot
│   ├── information-flow → Command, Information, HotSpot
│   └── system        → Event, HotSpot
└── Slices (vertical columns = steps)
    ├── Write slice   → exactly 1 Command (no Information)
    └── Read slice    → 1+ Information (no Commands)
```

### Element Placement Rules (STRICT)
| Element | `type` value | Allowed lane type |
|---|---|---|
| Command | `command` | `information-flow` |
| Event | `event` | `system` |
| Information | `information` | `information-flow` |
| Automation | `automation` | `user-lane` |
| UI | `ui` | `user-lane` |
| Hot Spot | `hotspot` | any |

**Never place commands and information in the same slice.**

### Business Rules Placement (STRICT)
- **Do NOT use HotSpots for business rules.** HotSpots are for open questions, bottlenecks, and unresolved issues only.
- Business rules, validation constraints, and invariants belong in the **command's `details` field** alongside Example and JSON Schema.

### Cross-Chapter Triggers (STRICT)
- When a write slice is triggered by events from **another chapter** (e.g., an automation in Creature Recruitment dispatches a command to Armies), do **NOT** add an Automation or UI element on the write slice in this chapter.
- The triggering context is modeled in the **other** chapter, not this one. This chapter only shows the command, event, and resulting state.

### Write-Read Slice Ordering (STRICT)
- Every write slice should be followed by a read slice so that events auto-connect to information via orange arrows.
- Standard chapter pattern: **Write → Read → Write → Read → ...**
- This ensures every event visibly feeds a read model on the board.

### Shared UI Naming
- When a UI element serves as both a read view and a trigger for a subsequent write slice, use the **same name** on both slices (e.g., "Army Creatures" on the read slice UI and the next write slice UI) to indicate they represent the same screen.

### Automatic Arrows (no manual wiring needed)
Connections are drawn automatically when elements are placed correctly:
- UI/Automation → Command (same slice)
- Command → Event (same slice)
- Event → Information (next slice)
- Information → UI/Automation (same slice)

## Workflows

### Read an Event Model
1. Resolve workspace (see "Before You Start")
2. `list_chapters` → pick chapter
3. `get_chapter` → full structure with all lanes, slices, elements
4. Present to user organized by slices (steps), showing the flow

### Plan and Model a New Chapter

Before creating anything, **plan the full chapter structure**:

1. **Count the slices** you'll need and prepare them upfront
2. **Remember the rules**: command and information must NOT be in the same slice
3. **Prepare the lanes**:
   - Who participates in the chapter? (user roles → `user-lane`)
   - Which system contexts are involved? (→ `system` lanes)
4. **Determine the chapter's starting point**:
   - Is the outcome of another chapter the starting point? (event from another chapter)
   - Or is it started by a user role triggering a command in a UI?
5. **Identify cross-chapter dependencies**: Do we need information from another chapter for validation/business rules?
6. **Map the information flow** for the entire chapter before touching the board
7. **Validate the information flow** against the guidelines strictly
8. **Check if the chapter already exists**:
   - Yes → model on the existing chapter
   - No → `add_chapter` and model on the new one

#### Creating the Chapter
1. `add_chapter` with name and mode (`event-modeling`)
2. This creates default lanes (user-lane, information-flow, system) and initial slices
3. Rename lanes to match actual user roles and system contexts
4. Add/rename/remove slices for each step in the flow (Write → Read → Write → Read pattern)
5. **Verify ordering**: call `get_chapter` after adding slices — new slices may not insert at the expected index. Use `reorder_slices` to fix ordering **before** placing any elements.

### Add a Write Slice (Command → Event)
1. `get_chapter` to find lane IDs
2. `add_slice` with descriptive label at the right index
3. `add_element` — `automation` or `ui` in the `user-lane`
4. `add_element` — `command` in the `information-flow` lane, same slice
5. `add_element` — `event` in the `system` lane, same slice

### Add a Read Slice (Event → Information)
1. `add_slice` with descriptive label at the right index (after the write slice whose events feed it)
2. `add_element` — `information` in the `information-flow` lane
3. `add_element` — `ui` or `automation` in the `user-lane` (what consumes this info)

### Add an Automation (Event → Command)
Two patterns:
- **Direct reaction**: Place `automation` in user-lane of the write slice that it triggers
- **Task list**: Add a read slice with `information` (task list), then `automation` in user-lane of next write slice

### Updating Existing Models

When modifying an existing model, follow these rules strictly:

1. **Favor REORDERING over deletion and recreation** — use `reorder_slices` and `reorder_lanes` tools
2. **Don't rush** — plan ahead what you want to achieve so you don't mess up the model
3. **Always prepare the slice and lane structure first**
4. **Check that chapter details look correct after preparation** (`get_chapter`)
5. **Only when the basic slice ordering is correct**, start placing elements in slices

### Adding Details to Elements

After the flow structure is modeled and validated, enrich elements with details:

1. **Element description with properties** (optional): Add property names with example values or types directly in the element description via `update_element_description`. This makes properties visible on the board card itself. **Ask the user** whether to add description properties — it's not required.
2. **Element details**: Add detailed descriptions, JSON examples, JSON Schema, validation rules, and business rules via `update_element_details` / `update_element_description`
3. **UI mockups**: Add ASCII mockups to the `details` field of UI elements
4. **Slice details**: Add business rules and Given-When-Then scenarios to slice details via `update_slice_details` (see [Slice GWT Scenarios](#slice-gwt-scenarios) below)

#### Element Description Properties (Optional)

Element descriptions can list properties with example values or types. These are shown directly on the board card, making the data shape visible at a glance. Use `update_element_description` to set this.

**Format**: each property on its own line. End each line with **two trailing spaces** (`  `) to force a line break in markdown.

Example for a "Build Dwelling" command:
```
dwellingId: uuid
creatureId: Angel
costPerTroop: {gold: 3000, gems: 1}
```

Example for a "Dwelling Built" event:
```
dwellingId: uuid
creatureId: Angel
costPerTroop: {gold: 3000, gems: 1}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use domain-meaningful example values (e.g., `Angel` not `string`, `{gold: 3000, gems: 1}` not `object`)
- Use `uuid` as a type hint for identifiers
- This is **optional** — always ask the user if they want properties added to element descriptions
- Keep it concise — this is a summary, not a full schema (use `details` for that)

#### Slice GWT Scenarios (Optional)

Slice details (set via `update_slice_details`) can contain Given-When-Then scenarios — executable acceptance criteria that map directly to test methods. This is **optional** — ask the user whether to add GWT scenarios when documenting slices.

Use [references/SLICE_DOCUMENTATION.md](references/SLICE_DOCUMENTATION.md) as the starting template when a slice has no documentation.

**Element block syntax** inside GWT scenarios:
```
:::element <type>
<Element Name>
<optional key: value properties — only rule-relevant>
:::
```
Where `<type>` is: `command`, `event`, `information`, `hotspot`, `automation`.

**IMPORTANT — Trailing double spaces**: End **every line** inside `:::element` blocks with **two trailing spaces** (`  `) to force markdown line breaks. This includes the element name and each property line. Without trailing spaces, all lines render on a single line on proophboard.

**Key principle**: Only include properties that are **relevant to the business rule** being tested. E.g., BuildDwelling idempotency scenario only shows `dwellingId` (the uniqueness key) — `creatureId` and `costPerTroop` are omitted because they don't influence the rule.

##### GWT Patterns by Slice Type

**Write slice** — `Given (events) → When (command) → Then (events | hotspot | NOTHING)`:

```markdown
## Business Rules

<!-- WILL BE DERIVED FROM GWT Scenarios -->
- Dwelling can only be built once (idempotent)

## Scenarios (GWTs)

### 1. build for the first time

**Given**
NOTHING
**When**
:::element command
Build Dwelling
:::
**Then**
:::element event
Dwelling Built
:::

### 2. try to build already built

**Given**
:::element event
Dwelling Built
dwellingId: portal-of-glory
:::
**When**
:::element command
Build Dwelling
dwellingId: portal-of-glory
:::
**Then**
NOTHING
```

**Read slice** — `Given (events) → Then (information)` — no When block:

```markdown
## Scenarios (GWTs)

### 1. given creatures added, then show army

**Given**
:::element event
Creature Added To Army
creatureId: Angel
quantity: 5
:::
**Then**
:::element information
Army Creatures
stacks: [{creatureId: Angel, quantity: 5}]
:::
```

**Automation** — `Given (events) → Then (command | hotspot | NOTHING)` — no When block:

```markdown
## Scenarios (GWTs)

### 1. when week symbol proclaimed, increase available creatures

**Given**
:::element event
Week Symbol Proclaimed
:::
**Then**
:::element command
Increase Available Creatures
:::
```

##### Failure / Rejection in Then

Two forms:
- **Hotspot** — exception or broken business rule:
  ```
  :::element hotspot
  Exception
  Can have max 7 different creature stacks in the army
  :::
  ```
- **Failure event** — an explicit domain event representing a rejected outcome (e.g., `PaymentRejected`). This is a valid event, not an exception — model it as `:::element event`.

##### NOTHING Keyword

Use `NOTHING` for:
- **Empty Given** — no prior events (fresh state)
- **Empty Then** — no events produced (idempotent write) or no command dispatched (automation doesn't react)

##### Implementation Guidelines

Slice documentation may include a `## Implementation Guidelines` section with Backend and/or Frontend subsections. These contain specific technical requirements for the slice (e.g., integrate with a payment provider, create an S3 bucket, use a specific library). When present, these guidelines **must be followed** during implementation — they take priority over generic patterns.

#### Element Details Format

The `details` field supports markdown and has no strict structure — it can contain whatever is useful for the element. Common content for commands and events includes:

- **Example** — a concrete JSON instance showing what the message looks like
- **JSON Schema** — formal schema describing the message structure
- **Business rules** — validation constraints, invariants
- **Description** — free-text explanation of purpose or behavior
- Any other relevant documentation

Example of details for a command element:

````markdown
## Example

```json
{
  "dwellingId": "portal-of-glory",
  "creatureId": "angel",
  "costPerTroop": { "GOLD": 3000, "GEMS": 1 }
}
```

## JSON Schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "dwellingId": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "description": "Unique identifier for the dwelling"
    },
    "creatureId": {
      "type": "string",
      "minLength": 1,
      "description": "Identifier of the creature type"
    },
    "costPerTroop": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Resource cost per single troop",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "integer",
        "minimum": 0
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["dwellingId", "creatureId", "costPerTroop"]
}
```
````

**Guidelines for element details:**
- Event modeling typically happens **before code exists** — propose domain-meaningful example values and ask the user to confirm or adjust before writing
- In the less common case where code/tests already exist, derive example values from them for consistency. Read value objects and event classes to understand the full data shape — unwrap `value class` / `@JvmInline` wrappers to their raw type, and flatten nested data classes (e.g., `MonthWeek(month, week)` becomes separate `month` and `week` fields in JSON)
- Use meaningful IDs (e.g., `"portal-of-glory"` not `"uuid-123"`)
- JSON Schema should match the intended data structure (value classes unwrap to their raw type)
- When updating details, always pass the **complete new content** to `update_element_details` — partial string replacements cause conflicts on proophboard

### Track Implementation Progress

Update slice status to reflect code implementation state:
```
planned → in-progress → ready → deployed
```
Use `update_slice_status` with both `old_status` and `new_status`.

Derive implementation tasks from the event model — **one task per slice**. Update progress on proophboard using slice status as implementation proceeds.

### Monitor Board Changes

Use `list_changelog_events` to see recent updates made to the board by any user.

### Search Across the Board
Use `search_elements` to find elements by name or type across all chapters:
- Find all commands: `element_type: "command"`
- Find by name: `query: "Recruit"`
- Combine filters: `query: "Dwelling", element_type: "event"`

## Naming Conventions
- **Commands**: imperative — "Build Dwelling", "Recruit Creature"
- **Events**: past tense — "Dwelling Built", "Creature Recruited"
- **Information**: nouns — "Dwelling Details", "Available Creatures"
